Mod Jam Ideas, Benjamin Merhi

-Frog has a 1/500 chance of releasing 10 tongues
-Flies increase in speed as more are caught
-Adding a point system where every time a fly is caught it’s +1 point, and every time a fly is missed it’s -1 point
-Flies come from different directions, left/right, top/bottom
-Variations in size between flies
-Perhaps if your score goes in the negatives you lose
-As you reach certain point milestones the background changes colour
-Flies don’t go in a static/straight path
-Every now and then there will be a red fly that will serve as a “bomb fly” that if caught, explodes the frog and causes an immediate loss
-Adding a pause button
-Sometimes multiple flies will make an appearance, in a “V” formation, for coolness reasons
-A golden fly has a 1/100 chance of appearing, when caught it gives the frog increased tongue speed for the next 3 rounds
-After a certain amounts of points is passed, the frog will also shoot lasers out of its eyes
-Tongue can ricochet off the edge of the canvas
-Potentially adding a boss fight at a certain point, a fly that tries attacking you, a health bar will have to be added
-Adding a barrier on certain levels, forcing the user to use the ricochet to reach a fly
-An upgrade where the frog shoots cannon balls instead of using the tongue. Cannon balls will have a certain blast radius that will absolutely decimate any given fly, regardless of their might.
-Flies have a rare chance of dodging attacks, if an attack is dodged the user will have to re attempt catching the fly. Dodges are rare and will never been done consecutively.
-A wasp will sometimes fly across the screen, if caught one point is lost
-Adding sound effects for every modification. Bomb fly will have a certain sound, wasp will have a sound, etc.
-Fog/clouds have a  chance of appearing, obstructing the users view
