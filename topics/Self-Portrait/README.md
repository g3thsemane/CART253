## Description


> "When I Look In The Mirror" is a self portrait which features a blocky depiction of myself, and some level of interractivity for the user

> The user can engage with the porgram through pressing and holding the mouse, whilst moving it up and down in order to move the head

> In some ways, this work is a litmus test for the morality and ethics of people that engage with it. By moving the head, you are a killer, which says a lot about you.

> Used the map() function for the first time in order to change the background dependant on the the position of myHead variable. Used Offsets for the first time in order to keep all the head components attached properly during movement
