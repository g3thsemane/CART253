I was quite impressed when I first opened this project, it seems quite complex and multi-layered(all code is, I guess). The interractivty offered is simple yet fun, reminiscent of boss fights in early 2D games. I personally thought of the "Wall of Flesh" from Terraria for some reason when I encountred the Face, and also of a "Mii" from the Wii Nintendo console. The actual face has an interestinge makeup, with the third eye and all, I wonder if there was a specifc inspiration for the look. The code appears to be very well written, utilizing many different functions and variables. I enjoy how the canvas stretches across the entire length of the page. The mechanics are straight forward but I am not sure I understand the "double click to damage yourself. This is to view the damage system and the player health bar works"? I am not necessarily critiquing, but I think there is other ways this can be represented. Overall, very well done, very ominous, and very impressive.


-Dyna Benaziza: "TITLE OF PROJECT"

When I opened this project the first thing I thought of was the abstract work of Picasso, which I believe is what the creator was trying to emulate through the complex configuration of the human head. I like this project, it's simple, but nice. I always enjoy seeing traditional art, and contemporary mediums join together. This work features many complex shapes that I am sure took lot's of time to jot down one by one, but it all came together nicely. The interractivity is straightforward, but let's the user manipulate the face in ways that allows for different interpretations of the portrait to come through. I have to say, I can't really make out the "face" when opening the project, but I guess that's a fault on my end. The use of vivid colours is eye-catching and compliments the the facial tones. I read in the README that this was quite an experimental project, but regardless I think it was well done, and it would be cool to see more traditional art concepts done through coding.

This project is pretty simple but nonetheless, an enjoyable experience for the user. The individual pictured on the canvas appears to be a bit under the influence of marijuana(although this is disproven in the README), but that's how life has to be sometimes. The interractivity is nice, allowing the eyes to turn red when clicked, and featuring a Minecraft "injured sound" that is quite nostalgic for me. x . There's a good use of variables in the project, and I can really appreciate the sillyness of it all. As said in the README, this is definitely very hyper-realistic, I'm actually befuddled at the level of realism achieved. A satisfying interraction indeed, but I am not a fan of assaulting people so I do have to refrain to some degree.
